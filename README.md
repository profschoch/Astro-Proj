Astronomy Project Files<br>
The project consists of 3 phases:<br>
1.  create a simple interface to load and do a simple set of processing on a single image.<br>
2.  upgrade the first project with a GUI interface and allow simple rectification and color stacking a la the SAO software.<br>
3.  slowly add functionality to the GUI interface and menu system to move the program closer to AstroImageJ or AIP4WIN.<br>
<br>
Students, and others, will be recruited to aid in the development and testing of the software as it progresses.
